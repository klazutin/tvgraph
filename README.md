# TV Graph

A clone of [Graph TV](http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/) built for educational purposes.
Built with [Hug](http://www.hug.rest/), MongoDB, Beautiful Soup and Highcharts.

A couple of improvements over the original:
- Relies on live scraping of IMDB pages to get the most current ratings
- Less dependencies (no jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.) for lighter pages.

TODO:
- Add list of recently viewed shows.
